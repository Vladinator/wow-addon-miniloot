MiniLoot2
==================
Tired of loot spam in the chat? Wish there was a way to reduce the amount of messages generated by the game upon looting, reputation gain, experience gain, and so forth? This addon was created to counter just that!

Features
------------------
- Filter
  - Hide reputation, loot, currency, experience and gold messages. You can hide all the junk loot messages generated by the group, yourself or both. You may even set a item quality limit to what is hidden or not.
- Timing
  - You can group up several messages and generate a report of all changes that have happened in a specific time interval or after combat has ended. This helps avoid spam during fights.
- Extra
  - There are several extra features. To name a few: Pet Battle messages can be neatly summarized. Hover tooltips when you mouse over hyperlinks in the chat. Class coloring of names.

Stability
------------------
The addon has been tested with several languages, but with each major patch things may break. If you encounter issues please post them or submit a fix yourself.
